# Astro Basics

## Built with

- Astro
- Tailwind

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## ðŸš€ My journey with Astro @GomezJuan

Astro is a static site generator and a tool for building modern websites. It allows developers to create websites using a combination of familiar markup languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but with the added benefit of optimizing performance through its static site generation capabilities.

### Learning process

In the tag ```<slot />``` is where our routes are going to be renderized.

```<style is:global>```: Means the style is global

To add a library or a specific technology I can just type in the console ```npx astro add react```. Check it out [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/)

Whit ```npx astro add --list``` to list all the technologies availables.

### Fonts

[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/)

There, in fontsource I can find two types of fonts statics and variables, which means if my font support all the weights or not.

**Using Custom Fonts**

When using Tailwind it's possible to setup the fonts on the tailwind.config.mjs

[Check out here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/fonts/)

### JavaScript code

It is possible to add vanilla JS code that will be executed in the frontend Just using the ```<script>``` tag. This is important because it is also possible to write code between ```---```, but this code is going to be executed in the server side.

If I have the type check activated I can deactivate in a specific part just using ```// @ts-nocheck```

```JavaScript
<script>
  // @ts-nocheck
  const carouselList = document.querySelector(".carousel__list");
  const carouselItems = document.querySelectorAll(".carousel__item");
  const elems = Array.from(carouselItems);

  ...
</script>
```

### Animating the svg

That was one of the most challenges things on the web.

- the SVGs are fragmented by section

- When the width is enought for each section to get the 100vh all the SVGs are in the front

### CSS

**White-space property**

```CSS
div {
  /* This is the default, you don't need to
     explicitly declare it unless overriding
     another declaration */
  white-space: normal; 
}
```

If you want to prevent the text from wrapping, you can apply `white-space: nowrap`;

**SVG <path> the basics**

SVG has a limited number of defined shapes. For everything else, there is the `<path>` element. The shape of a path is given by the **"d"** attribute. According to the specs, d stands for **data**; but it could just as well stand for **directions**. It's a string of codes and coordinates that tell the program what type of line to draw, and where to draw it.

- **M or m**: "Move" command. Followed by two numbers, the first giving the x (horizontal) position and the second the y (vertical) position.

- **L or l**: "Line" command. Followed by an even number of numbers, which are interpretted as (x,y) pairs.

- **H or h**: "Horizontal line" command. Followed by one or more numbers.

- **V or v**: "Vertical line" command. Followed by one or more numbers.

- These are the most common, but there's more..
